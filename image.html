  <h2>Difference between lossy and lossless compression in images</h2>
  <p>The difference between Lossy and Lossless compression is that Lossy compression takes away parts of the file that are not needed or noticed to make them smaller.</p>
  <h2>Why is it important for Web Designers to compress image files?</h2>
  <p>It is important to compress your images because if you have a large image it can make the loading of the website really long and then no one will want to go on your website</p>
  <h2>How compression effects the quality of the data</h2>
  <p>When you compress the data the quality only changes a little bit and you can't see much of a difference.</p>
